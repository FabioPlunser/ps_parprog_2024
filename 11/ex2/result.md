# Task 1

> Investigate any loops that carry larger workloads and determine if and how they can be parallelized. Parallelize them with OpenMP. Ensure that any code modification does not violate program correctness with respect to its output.


# Task 2

> Benchmark the original, sequential program and your parallelized version for 1, 2, 6 and 12 threads on LCC3, discuss the results and enter the data in the comparison spreadsheet linked on Discord.
