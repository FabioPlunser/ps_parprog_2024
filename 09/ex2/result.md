# Task 1

> Vectorize your sequential program using OpenMP. Do not use any OpenMP thread-based parallelism.

# Task 2

> Compile your OpenMP-vectorized code with `-O1` but without any compiler flags for auto-vectorization and compare its performance for the problem size 2048 to both the sequential version and the compiler-vectorized version. What can you observe? Is the result still correct?

# Task 3

> Verify any findings using `perf` as described in Exercise 1.

# Task 4

> Repeat the sequential and OpenMP executions when changing the data type from `float` to `double`. What can you observe?

# Task 5

> How does the solution for this Exercise compare to Exercise 1? Are there any advantages or disadvantages?

# Task 6

> Enter the wall clock time of the OpenMP-vectorized version with size 2048, 1e6 repetitions and data type `float` to the spreadsheet linked on Discord.
