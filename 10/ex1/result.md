# Task 1

> Implement a sequential program that computes the Delannoy number for a square 2D grid of size NxN where N is an input parameter for your program. If in doubt, base your implementation on the formula given in the Wikipedia article under "basic recurrence relation". Make sure your program is semantically correct by comparing the result against the Delannoy numbers given in the article.



# Task 2

> Parallelize your program using OpenMP tasks and benchmark both the sequential and parallel implementation for several N between 3 and ~15. What can you observe?



# Task 3

> What is the main bottleneck of your parallel implementation and how can it be improved without changing the underlying algorithm?



# Task 4

> Enter the wall clock time of the sequential version and the parallel version for 1 and 12 threads for N=12 on LCC3 to the comparison spreadsheet linked on Discord.
